### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Nice to meet you, I'm Rameez!

Welcome to my Profile! I'm a senior data scientist with a background in software engineering. Currently, I leverage my expertise in a financial service institution to drive data-driven decision-making. With a decade of experience, I'm passionate about breaking free from traditional approaches and harnessing the transformative power of data and artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize industries. Ethical considerations surrounding AI and its impact on society are particularly important to me.

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bath, UK, where I explore the intricacies of AI and delve into its ethical dimensions.
